  Set the Upload 'profile', for validation during upload proccess:

```php
include('class/path/file.php');

$profile = array(
        "types" => array("jpeg", "jpg", "png"), // which filetypes are accepted
        "folder" => "./uploads/", // which folder your files go, for this specific profile, on your local server
        "size" => 266000, // max size of file upload
        "total" => 10, // total files that can be upload on this input
        "vars" => array(), // additional vars that will be passed to frontend and backend
);

Upload::addProfile('image', $profile);
